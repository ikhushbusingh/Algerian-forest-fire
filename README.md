Objective: Utilize machine learning to predict and prevent forest fires in Algeria by analyzing historical data and environmental factors.

Method: Gather historical fire incident data, along with environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and vegetation cover. Train a machine learning model to predict the likelihood and severity of forest fires based on these factors.

Conclusion: Implementing the trained model in monitoring systems can provide early warnings and guide preventive measures, mitigating the impact of forest fires in Algeria and safeguarding both ecosystems and communities.
